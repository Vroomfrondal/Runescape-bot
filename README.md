# Runescape-bot (V2 in Development)

An automation robot for the classic 2000's game Runescape. It uses the robotjs NPM library to provide mouse, keyboard, and screen bitmapping capabilities. Currently functional on oak and standard tree's in game.

**A word of warning**: running this script on a Jagex owned server will most likely result in you being banned.

**Technologies Used:**

- RobotsJS - NPM library used for Desktop Automation. Read about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs)
- NodeJS
- Javascript

**Bot's Current Capabilities:**

- Automation of woodcutting normal tree's in lumbridge via index.js
- Automation of melee training at rock crabs via rockcrabs.js

**Installation:**

- Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- in your console, "npm install robotjs" will install the robotsjs library
- Use a private server (unless you want rapidly banned on Runescape). I prefer [this one](https://ikov.io/)
