# Runescape-bot

A GUI automation bot for the classic 2000's game Runescape. Please note I've only developed this on private servers to therefore not effect the integrity of the game. As botting for personal reasons, even coding practice, is against the game-rules.

**A word of warning**: running this script on a Jagex Owned server will most likely result in you being banned. I have added almost no error control, and the Jagex developers have been hunting bots in game for years longer than I've been coding them.
