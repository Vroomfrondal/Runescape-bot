# Runescape-bot

A GUI automation bot for the classic 2000's game Runescape. Please note I've only developed this on private servers to therefore not effect the integrity of the game. As botting for personal reasons, even coding practice, is against the game-rules.

**A word of warning**: running this script on a Jagex owned server will most likely result in you being banned.

**Technologies Used:**

- RobotsJS - NPM library used for Desktop Automation. Read about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs)
- NodeJS
- Javascript

**Installation**

- Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- in your console, "npm install robotjs" will install the robotsjs library node-modules
- Use a private server (unless you want rapidly banned on Runescape). I prefer [this one](https://ikov.io/).
