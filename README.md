# Runescape-bot

A GUI automation bot for the classic 2000's game Runescape.

**A word of warning**: running this script on a Jagex owned server will most likely result in you being banned.

**Technologies Used:**

- RobotsJS - NPM library used for Desktop Automation. Read about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs)
- NodeJS
- Javascript

**Installation**

- Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- in your console, "npm install robotjs" will install the robotsjs library node-modules
- Use a private server (unless you want rapidly banned on Runescape). I prefer [this one](https://ikov.io/).
