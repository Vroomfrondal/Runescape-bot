# GUI Automation Bot - RS

A GUI automation robot for the classic 2000's game Runescape. It uses the robotjs NPM library to provide mouse, keyboard, and screen bitmapping capabilities

**A word of warning:** running any of these scripts on a server where its not allowed, will most likely result in you being banned.

**Technologies Used:**

-   RobotsJS - NPM library used for Desktop Automation.
-   NodeJS
-   Javascript

**Bot's Current Capabilities:**

-   3 Agility Scripts
-   2 Combat Scripts
-   2 Dungeoneering Scripts
-   3 Fishing Scripts
-   3 Woodcutting Scripts

**Installation:**

-   Clone repo
-   in the root folder of the project, "npm install" will install the RobotJS dependencies
-   Use a private server (unless you want rapidly banned on Runescape). I prefer [this one](https://ikov.io/)
