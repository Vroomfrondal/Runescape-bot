# GUI automation bot

A GUI automation robot for the classic 2000's game Runescape. It uses the robotjs NPM library to provide mouse, keyboard, and screen bitmapping capabilities

**A word of warning**: running any of these scripts on a server where its not allowed, will most likely result in you being banned.

**Technologies Used:**

- RobotsJS - NPM library used for Desktop Automation. Read about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robotjs)
- NodeJS
- Javascript

**Bot's Current Capabilities:**

- 3 Agility Scripts
- 2 Combat Scripts
- 2 Dungeoneering Scripts
- 3 Fishing Scripts
- 3 Woodcutting Scripts

**Installation:**

- Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- in your console, "npm install robotjs" will install the robotsjs library
- Use a private server (unless you want rapidly banned on Runescape). I prefer [this one](https://ikov.io/)
- "node scriptname.js" in your console / bash to run a script
