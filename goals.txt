Steps:

1) add willow functionality: check line 79 where you added oak log functionality which is used to drop oak logs but not properly cut them
    a) to add this, extend timers so you can chop the tree a while

2) update readme that V1 is complete

3) create new file. mining.js, that will be a mining bot. node mining.js to run :)
